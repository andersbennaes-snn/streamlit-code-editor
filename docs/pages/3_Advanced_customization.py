The top two corners of the editor component are rounded which does not allow for a seemless connection of the left and right edges with the edges of the info/menu bar. On top of this, you might want the bars to appear on the bottom or even on the sides of the editor instead of on top. This is where `css` and `style` attributes really come in to play. ")

On the right is the physical layout of the Code Editor component in the Streamlit app. Here, there are somethings to note. By default, the Code Editor component has its CSS `display` property set to "flex" and its `flex-direction` property set to "column". This means that Code Editor will stack its inner components on top of one another in a column. Additionally, the Ace Editor component has its CSS `order` property set to "3". Altogether, this provides a default setup that allows for easy rearrangment of the stacking order of the components inside the Code Editor. For example, setting the `order` property of the info bar component to a value less than 3 will put it above the Ace Editor like in the examples in the previous section. Setting it to 3 or greater will put the info bar below.')

For example, the `style` attribute of the info bar dictionary is used to set the `style` property of the info bar component. In contrast, Ace Editor's `style` property is set via the `style` attribute in the dictionary you give to the `props` argument of the `code_editor` function.
